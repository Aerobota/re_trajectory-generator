Elements of the release
=======================

TrajectoryGenerator
-------------------
 *   This component implements two event ports which listen to commanded
 *   Cartesian positions and/or joint angles of a robot.
 *   Based on the commands and the current state (position, VELOCITY) of the
 *   robot a time optimal velocity profile is created, using the
 *   VelocityProfile_NonZeroInit class, and the joint positions are sequentially
 *   sent out on an outputPort.
 *   The provided working example makes use of the kinematic solver given by
 *   in the KUKALWR_Kinematics class. However, by selectin an appropriate
 *   kinematics Solver, the component can be used to control any other robotic
 *   manipulator.

VelocityProfile_NonZeroInit
---------------------------
 *   This class extends the VelocityProfile abstract class, generating velocity
 *   profiles which are time optimal (subjected to maximum accelerations and
 *   velocities) and may have non-zero initial velocities.
 *   It calculates the polynomials of piece-wise linear velocity profiles and
 *   the corresponding position and acceleration profiles.
 *   Then it provides functions to obtain position/velocity/acceleration
 *   of the trajectory at a certain time instant.

KUKALWR_Kinematics
------------------
 *   This class defines the kinematic transformations on the KUKA LWR Robot
 *
 *   The Forward Kinematics transformation considers the whole 7 DOF of the
 *   robot, while the Inverse Kinematics only calculates 6 Joints, setting
 *   the extra DOF to zero. This allows us to obtain a closed-form solution
 *   for the inverse kinematics.
 *
 *   The equations of this closed-form solution are based on the IK of an
 *   anthropomorphic arm with a spherical wrist given in the book
 *   "Robotics - Modelling, Planning and Control", by Siciliano et al. (2010)
 *   Only one of the four possible solutions for the kinematic
 *   chain is calculated. Specifically, the right-shoulder elbow-up one.
